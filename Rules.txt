Each cell has 8 neighbors (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal)

1. Any live cell with under two live neighbors dies (under-population)
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies (over-population)
4. Any empty cell with exactly three neighbors becomes live
