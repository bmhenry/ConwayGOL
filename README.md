# ConwayGOL  &nbsp;&nbsp;[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bmhenry/ConwayGOL.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bmhenry/ConwayGOL)

A simple "Conway's Game of Life" emulator, written using C++ in Qt.

Mostly I just wanted to try out Travis CI, so I used this as an excuse to build something new and test it.
